This script lets you import a virtual machine disk image to RHEV or
oVirt.

IMPORTANT NOTES:

(1) In the latest oVirt/RHEV/RHV there is a GUI option to import
disks.  You DO NOT NEED TO USE THIS SCRIPT if you are using a
sufficiently new version of oVirt.

(2) This script *requires* a 64 bit host.  Perl will cause silent
overflows on 32 bit hosts.


Requirements:

    perl
  * perl-Pod-Usage (on debian/ubuntu: perl-doc)
  * perl-Getopt-Long
  * perl-File-Temp
  * perl-POSIX
    perl-XML-Writer (on debian/ubuntu: libxml-writer-perl)
    perl-Sys-Guestfs (on debian libsys-virt-perl)
    uuid-runtime

* = usually provided as part of base Perl package

For instructions, read the script or do:

  ./import-to-ovirt.pl --help
  ./import-to-ovirt.pl --man
